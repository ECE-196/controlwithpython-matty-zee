### How does the DevBoard handle received serial messages? How does this differ from the na√Øve approach?
The DevBoard handles serial messages by using interrupts and interrupt handlers, which is event driven. This is different fron the naive approach which involves using the `loop()` and repeatedly running `read()` if serial data is available, which isn't event driven. 
### What does `detached_callback` do? What would happen if it wasn't used?
`detached_callback` spawns a deatached thread. If we do not use it, the program will halt every time the user interacts with the GUI. 
### What does `LockedSerial` do? Why is it _necessary_?
`LockedSerial` atomizes function calls by overriding their inherited function but with with a lock acquisition before their call. This is necessary as it prevents undefined behavior due to race conditions.
